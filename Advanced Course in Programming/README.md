This is a final project work I did for Advanced Course in Programming in 2024. More detailed instructions can be found here https://programming-24.mooc.fi/part-14/4-your-own-game

There weren't any strick guidelines given and I did have some fun with the execution! The images (robo.png and hirvio.png) were given but everything else was deisgned by me from the scratch.
